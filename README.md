The **AI Village Doctor Assistant** is a prototype designed to bring basic healthcare support to rural villages where access to doctors is limited.  

## ðŸš‘ Problem  
- Villagers often donâ€™t have quick access to doctors.  
- Small health problems turn into big issues because of delays.  
- Many struggle to understand prescriptions in English or non-local languages.  

## ðŸ’¡ Solution  
An **AI-powered chatbot** that can:  
- Answer common health questions.  
- Suggest first-aid remedies.  
- Explain medicines in simple language.  
- Provide support in local languages (Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, etc.).  
- Alert villagers when they should see a real doctor.  

## ðŸ”§ How It Works  
- Uses **OpenAI ChatGPT API** for Q&A and symptom checks.  
- Uses translation to support multiple local languages.  
- Embedding API for knowledge base of common illnesses & medicines.  

## ðŸš€ Future Plan  
1. Build chatbot MVP with OpenAI API.  
2. Add offline & multilingual support.  
3. Connect with local clinics for emergencies.  
4. Expand to WhatsApp/Telegram for easy access.
